# Onyx Examples

This repository houses the collection of examples used on the official [Onyx website](https://onyxlang.io/examples).
It exists here on GitHub for feedback and correction through [issues](https://github.com/onyx-lang/onyx-examples/issues),
and community contributions through [pull requests](https://github.com/onyx-lang/onyx-examples/pulls).


## Contributing

If you have an example you would like to see on the website, I would love to include it!

To submit an example, create a fork of this respository, add the example to
your fork, then make a pull request on this repository. Your example will be
reviewed, and I reserve the right to request modifications before merging the
pull request.

Each pull request should contain **only one new example**.
This way, if one of your examples get hung up in review, another example
could be merged immediately.
