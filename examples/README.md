# Onyx Examples

This repository houses the collection of examples used on the official [Onyx website](https://onyxlang.io/examples).
It exists here on GitHub for feedback and correction through [issues](https://github.com/onyx-lang/onyx-examples/issues),
and community contributions through [pull requests](https://github.com/onyx-lang/onyx-examples/pulls).


## Contributing

If you have an example you would like to see on the website, I would love to include it!

To submit an example, create a fork of this respository, add the example to
your fork, then make a pull request on this repository. Your example will be
reviewed, and I reserve the right to request modifications before merging the
pull request.

Each pull request should contain **only one new example**.
This way, if one of your examples get hung up in review, another example
could be merged immediately.

You will also need to install [`mdbook`](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) to compile the pages locally.

First, fork the repository and clone it onto your machine. From there, you can make necessary edits.
You can see them live by running the following.
```sh
mdbook serve
```

When you are ready, open a [pull request](https://github.com/onyx-lang/onyx-examples/) on this repository and it will be reviewed!
